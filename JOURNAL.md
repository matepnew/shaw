## 10/9/2025 3 AM - Made schematic  

Started by following the guide; added capacitors to power lines, USB-C and its voltage regulator, crystal oscillator, flash memory and I/O headers. Also researched a bit about decoupling capacitors and piezoelectricity (very cool). Planning to maybe add support for a battery and start making the PCB tomorrow.

## 10/9/2025 7 PM - Added battery charging  

I added support for battery charging with a Texas Instrument BQ24074 chip to make the devboard more versatile. Also rearranged the schematic to add space for said battery charger without having to expand the schematic and added a nice title. Will take a silksong break and afterwards start making the PCB.
