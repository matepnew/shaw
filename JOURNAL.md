## 10/8/2025 - Made schematic  

Started by following the guide; added capacitors to power lines, USB-C and its voltage regulator, crystal oscillator, flash memory and I/O headers. Also researched a bit about decoupling capacitors and piezoelectricity (very cool). Planning to maybe add support for a battery and start making the PCB tomorrow.

## 10/9/2025 - Added battery charging  

I added support for battery charging with a Texas Instrument BQ24074 chip to make the devboard more versatile. Also rearranged the schematic to add space for said battery charger without having to expand the schematic and added a nice title. Will take a silksong break and afterwards start making the PCB.

## 10/12/2025 - Started work on the PCB  

With the schematics done, I started reading the guide's section on the PCB. As such, I started by adding the footprints for each component. As I entered the PCB editor, I noticed there were a few minor errors in the schematic, which I fixed. Afterwards, I placed the header pins, RP2040, USB receptacle, crystal oscillator and decoupling capacitors following the guide. Also began routing the PCB, though I'm still missing most of it. Planning on finding a spot for the battery charger and finishing the PCB soon so I can start working on the other projects I have in mind.
