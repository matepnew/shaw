## 10/9/2025 - Made schematic  

Started by following the guide; added capacitors to power lines, USB-C and its voltage regulator, crystal oscillator, flash memory and I/O headers. Also researched a bit about decoupling capacitors and piezoelectricity (very cool). Planning to maybe add support for a battery and start making the PCB tomorrow.
